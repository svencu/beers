# Git Assignment

- Make teams of 2 to 3 ppl
- One creates a Repository and adds the rest of the team as
  collaborators (see repo "Settings")
- All of you clone the repository on your local machine (make sure you
  are not cloning inside another git repo!)
  - `git clone git@github.com:NAME/REPO.git`
- Recreate the Beer project together, but spread the work in different
  files, e.g.:
  - 1 person makes the Beer class file
  - 1 person makes the Person, Bartender, and Customer class files

Remember the Git "mantra":

  1. Pull (`git pull`)
  1. Change/create/delete files as you wish
  2. Add (`git add file_name_here`)
  3. Commit (`git commit -m "message here"`)
  4. Push (`git push`)
